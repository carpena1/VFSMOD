Instructions for using VFSMOD executables in this folder
--------------------------------------------------------
Some binaries are provided here for recent versions. Those without extension are macOS binaries, those with .exe are Windows binaries. You might need to rename them to use them in some applications (VFSMOD-GUI, etc.), i.e. vfsm461.exe --> vfsm.exe, or Mac vfsm461 -->vfsm.
